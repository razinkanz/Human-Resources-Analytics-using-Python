Hai i'm Razin Kanz and this is my data analytics personal project

I'm using a dataset that I found from Kaggle about human resource information such as employees demographic, performance score, absence and tardiness rate, etc. The dataset is about an anonymous corporate and was created by Dr. Rich and Dr. Carla Patalano. 

link to kaggle dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set 

in this project i will attempt to :
1. Explore the dataset to understand and identify important variables
2. Create visualization so reader can easily understand important human resource information in this corporate
3. Create and evaluate machine learning models that can predict employees with good performance score
